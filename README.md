Dark Souls mods for individual people

Dark Anor Londo Respawn Mod: In Dark Anor Londo you'll respawn at the last bonfire rested at, rather than being forced to respawn at the first bonfire in Anor Londo.

Quelaag Removal Mod: For the arachnophobes. Quelaag will be vanquished upon entering the fog wall. No cutscene will play, nor will you see her.

Undead Burg Door Fix Mod: You know the shortcut door between Undead Burg and Lower Undead Burg? The one that blocks most of the narrow stairway down? This mod flips it around so it opens into the room instead.

BetterChaos(noGD): Someone specifically requested that the Giant Dad be removed from the BetterChaos Mod. Here it is.
